AJAX AutoComplete for TinyMCE provides inline autocomplete in a style similar to Twitter or Facebook.  The text you type in tinyMCE is checked against a list of specified options; if there is a match then you will see them appear in a list underneath the caret. This plugin was originally designed for PriorityCentre, a task and meeting management application developed by Mijura (https://mijura.com).  

This fork has been updated to provide generation of autocomplete list on-the-fly with AJAX. Use at your own risk. Also you can visit my page: http://www.sib.li :-)

Server should return data in this format:
```
{
	"ok":1,
	"DATA": {
		"OK":1,
		123:{"name":"autocompleted item 1"},
		124:{"name":"autogenerated blah-blah"},
		125:{"name":"autotraining sux"}
	},
	"ERRORS":[]
}
```

To configure use autocomplete_options_url setting (without autocomplete_options):
```
autocomplete_options_url: "/path/to/my/ajax.php",
```

This plugin has been tested in Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer 9. It currently does not support IE7/8.

## Requirements
Autocomplete requires TinyMCE with the jQuery package, available for download here: http://www.tinymce.com/download/download.php

## Autocomplete options
There are four parameters that need to be specified in your tinyMCE config:

1. autocomplete_delimiters - A CSV list of delimiters (ASCII codes) on which to split text entered into tinyMCE. In most cases you will want to split text by spaces, in which case you would specify '160,32'. 32 is a normal space and 160 is &amp;nbsp; (which is commonly used by tinyMCE). Whichever delimiter you specify first will be inserted after you select an option.  The default is '160,32' for spaces. 
2. autocomplete_options - A CSV list OR Javascript Object "options". 
   1. A CSV List like "john,jane,william"
   2. JSON-like "options" array of objects havaing a key and a description ( both visible to user key and description, key is only used for autocomplete features ) 
      "options": [
                  {
                        "key": "Attila",
                        "description": "- The <i>Great</i> Hun"
                  }
               ]
3. autocomplete_trigger -  You can specify a trigger character that must be type immediately before searching for options.  The default trigger is '@' 
4. autocomplete_end_option - Any text that you want to be added after the option.  The caret will be placed between the option and this ending text.  For example, you could specify 'end', in which case selecting an autocomplete option would insert: '@jane  @end' with the caret placed in between (and including the trigger before the end option).
5. autocomplete_min_length - The minimum number of characters a word needs to have before the autocomplete activates. Only active when autocomplete_trigger is ''. The default is 3.
6. autocomplete_on_select - A function to call after an option is selected. The default is false.
7. autocomplete_on_match - A function to call when text entered match only one option. The default is false.

## Configuration with TinyMCE

Copy the autocomplete folder (in src) to the plugins directory of your TinyMCE installation.  

Include the autocomplete plugin in your TinyMCE configuration, this might look like:

```
plugins : "autolink,lists,pagebreak,style,layer,advlink,emotions,advlist,autocomplete",
```

 Add the configuration options for the autocomplete plugin, e.g.:

```
// Required
autocomplete_options: "john,jane,william", 

OR (if you prefer showing description along the keys)

autocomplete_options: {
						"options": [
							{
								"key": "Attila",
								"description": "- The <i>Great</i> Hun <hr /> <iframe src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3451/3233621766_e4f6db7a22_m.jpg\"></iframe>"
							},
							{
								"key": "Kattila",
								"description": "/ The Great B<b>um</b>"
							},
							{
								"key": "JustKey",
								"description": "* Just a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/enersizetech\">link</a>"
							}
						]
 					  },
// Optional
autocomplete_delimiters: "160,32",		// Optional and this is the default 
autocomplete_trigger: "@",			// Optional and this is the default
autocomplete_end_option: "end",			// Optional and by default no ending text is inserted
```

Include (and customize) the CSS in src/styles/autocomplete.css on the page with your TinyMCE installation.
